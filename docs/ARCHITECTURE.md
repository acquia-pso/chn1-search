# Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

### Core Principles
1. **Component-Based Design**: The application is built using a modular component architecture, allowing for easy maintenance and scalability.
2. **State Management**: URL-based state management ensures shareable search states and browser navigation compatibility.
3. **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript types ensure data consistency across the application.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data access, business logic, and presentation layers.

## Layer Architecture

### 1. Data Access Layer (`src/libraries/data-access-yext/`)
- **Purpose**: Handles all interactions with Yext APIs
- **Key Components**:
  - `yext-store.ts`: Manages search state using URL parameters
  - `yext-types.ts`: TypeScript definitions for API responses and data structures
  
#### State Management
- Uses URL parameters as the source of truth for search state
- Prefixes all Yext-related parameters with `yext_`
- Supports serialization/deserialization of complex objects
- Maintains search settings including:
  - Search input
  - Pagination (offset/limit)
  - Filters
  - Facet selections
  - Sort options

### 2. Business Logic Layer (`src/controllers/`)
- **Purpose**: Implements business rules and coordinates between data and presentation layers
- **Key Features**:
  - Search logic coordination
  - Filter management
  - Pagination handling
  - Response transformation

### 3. Presentation Layer (`src/components/`)

#### Universal Search (`outline-yext-universal/`)
- Implements cross-vertical search functionality
- Manages universal search results display
- Handles intent detection and vertical switching
- Custom CSS styling for universal search interface

#### Vertical Search (`outline-yext-vertical/`)
- Specialized search within specific verticals
- Vertical-specific result formatting with teaser components
- Custom filtering options per vertical
- Responsive grid layout for search results

#### Pager Component (`outline-yext-pager/`)
- Handles result pagination
- Maintains page state
- Provides navigation controls
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop

#### Search Container (`SearchContainer.tsx`)
- React-based search container component
- Manages search state and interactions
- Integrates with other search components
- Provides context for search functionality

#### Entity Display (`outline-yext-entities/`)
- Standardized entity rendering
- Support for different entity types
- Customizable display templates

### 4. Shared UI Layer (`src/libraries/ui-yext/`)
- Common UI components
- Shared styling
- Reusable UI utilities

## Data Flow

1. **User Input**
   ```
   User Action → URL Update → State Change → API Request → UI Update
   ```

2. **Search Flow**
   ```
   Search Input → State Update → API Query → Response Processing → Result Display
   ```

3. **Filter Flow**
   ```
   Filter Selection → URL Update → State Change → Search Refresh → UI Update
   ```

## Performance Considerations

### State Management
- URL-based state management enables:
  - Shareable search results
  - Browser navigation support
  - Persistent search state
  - SEO-friendly URLs
  - Real-time state synchronization

### API Optimization
- Efficient query construction
- Response caching where appropriate
- Batch requests when possible
- Pagination to limit response size

### UI Performance
- Component-level code splitting
- Lazy loading of results
- Optimized re-rendering
- Efficient state updates

### Testing Infrastructure
- Playwright for end-to-end testing
- Component-level unit tests
- Integration tests for search functionality
- Performance testing and monitoring

## Future Considerations

### Scalability
- Support for additional verticals
- Enhanced filter capabilities
- Advanced search features
- Performance optimizations

### Maintainability
- Component documentation
- Type system maintenance
- Test coverage
- Code organization

### Extensibility
- Plugin architecture for new features
- Custom vertical support
- Enhanced UI customization
- Additional API integrations
